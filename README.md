# AI-Powered Resume Screening  
Resume-Screening is an intelligent tool that automates and optimizes the job screening process using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and TF-IDF-based cosine similarity. It accurately ranks resumes against job descriptions to identify the best-fit roles for candidates â€” all in seconds.  

ðŸ“˜ Project Overview  

This project leverages the power of spaCy and scikit-learn to match candidate resumes with job descriptions by calculating similarity scores. By transforming raw text into meaningful vectors, the system makes it easy to:

* Preprocess text data (resumes & job roles)
* Vectorize with TF-IDF
* Measure cosine similarity
* Rank job roles by fit score

Whether you're a recruiter or developer, this tool saves time and improves hiring accuracy.
